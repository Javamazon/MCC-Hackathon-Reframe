                <h2 class="lora">Created for the Moms Can:Code Fall 2018 Hackathon contest, Reframe is one team’s solution to overcoming Impostor Syndrome. As we are women in tech, we often have self-doubt or feelings of inadequacy even when we are completely qualified and more than competent in our fields. Although Imposter Syndrome is not limited to women, we found through casual discussion that many of us felt similarly. Reframe is designed to show us clearly how that nasty little voice in our head really sounds, and how we need to change the narrative we tell ourselves. Sometimes we are not aware of what we say inside, or we just can’t put it into words. However, putting it into words, and then having it reframed can help us to zero in on what we are really thinking and feeling, while also giving us a much better thing to say.</h2> 

                <h2 class="lora top">From all of us to all of you we say, “You’ve got this! You are incredible!!”</h2>
